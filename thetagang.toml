[option_chains]
# The option chains are lazy loaded, and before you can determine the greeks

# negative value such as -1 (for -100%).

# placement out over time (and possibly expirations) in order to protect
# yourself from large swings. This value does not affect rolling existing
# contracts to the next expiration. This value is expressed as a percentage of
# buying power based on the market price of the underlying ticker, as a range
# from [0.0-1.0].
# 
# Once the `roll_when.dte` date is reached, all the remaining positions are
# rolled regardless of the current position quantity.

#  3) Have options with sufficient open interest and trading volume
